# Release v2.2.1

**Release Date**: December 04, 2025

#### Backward compatibility change to be aware:
- **Electode Mapping**: We changed the mapping functionality from the **flex-seach** to the **simulator**. This to provide a more flexible and dynamic framework. Now, the flex-search outputs the: `electrode_positions.json` file and the mapping functionality happeneds on the simulator side using the new method `ti-toolbox/tools/map_electrodes.py`. Thus, one can use a single flex-search to conveniently map to multiple nets. 

#### Additions
- **Desktop App**: Recognizing the importance of Desktop delivery, we redesign our executables with Electron. For more info please see `package`.
- **Benchmarks**: Added benchmarking tool with sensible defaults that users can run on their systems
- **AMV**: Improved automatic montage visualization that now supports all available nets with a higher resolution image.
- **Flex-search**: Added more control over electrode geometry now supporting rectengular and width control.
- **Flex-search**: Exapnded hyper-parameter control. tolerance and mutation rate. 

#### Fixes
- **Various Bug Fixes**: protection overwrites, documentation, output formatting, UI improvements, parallel processing, electrode management
