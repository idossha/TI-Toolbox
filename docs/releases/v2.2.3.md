**Original Release Date**: January 07, 2026
**Effective Release Date**: January 14, 2026 (re-uploaded tag with preprocessing refactored to deal with recon-all problem without releasing and official new image. Should be updated automatically to all users without breaking behavior).

#### Additions
- **New Blender Tool for Full Blend File Creation**: Complete Blender integration with automated blend file generation, electrode positioning, and visualization setup. Streamlined workflow for creating publication-ready 3D visualizations directly from simulation results.
- **Ex-search**: Added an option to run the a truly exhaustive search option as all selected electrodes are pooled together instead of placed in stationary buckets. Refer to ex-search wiki tab for more information.
- **New Correlation Mode for Cluster-Based Permutation Testing**: Enhanced statistical analysis capabilities with correlation-based cluster permutation testing, providing more robust statistical inference for connectivity and relationship analyses.
- **Unified Command-Line Experience**: All CLI tools now support both interactive mode (run without arguments) and direct mode (with flags). Consistent colored output, clear prompts, and intelligent option discovery across all commands.
- **Multi-Processing Simulator**: Parallel processing capabilities for faster simulation runs, optimized resource utilization, and scalable performance across different hardware configurations.
- **Enhanced Testing Suite Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage expansion including simulator workflows, statistical analysis pipelines, and integration testing for improved reliability and stability.
- **Improved Security CI/CD Pipeline**: Strengthened GitHub Actions workflows with enhanced security scanning, automated vulnerability detection, and improved code quality gates throughout the development pipeline.
- **Refactored pre-processing tools**: Removed all bash scripts to improved maintainability and reduce complexity. Updated all relevant benchmarks, tests, and docs. 

#### Fixes
- **Experimental Movea Tool**: Temporarily removed the experimental movea tool to focus development efforts on core functionality and stability.
- **Bug Fixes & Reliability**: Fixed GUI crashes and timeout issues. Improved path handling and import reliability. Updated electrode templates for better compatibility. Enhanced security scanning and CI/CD workflows.
- **Documentation Updates**: New CLI and GUI documentation pages. Improved Blender integration instructions. Added visualizer documentation. Better organization of documentation images.
