#### Fixes
- pre-process -> added missing shell for recon-all step
- pre-process -> fixed parallalization problem
- ex-search redesign -> now is not dependent on MATLAB Runtime, but is fully Python implemented

### v2.0.3

**Release Date**: June 20, 2025

#### Additions
- Modified tes_flex_optimization.py to include eeg_net field in the .json
- toggle between "Montage Simulation" (traditional) and "Flex-Search Simulation" with automatic discovery of optimization results and electrode type selection (mapped/optimized/both)
