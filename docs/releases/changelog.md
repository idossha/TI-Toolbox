### v2.0.4 (Latest Release)

**Release Date**: June 26, 2025

#### Additions
- flex-search -> simulator integration. Simulator now recognizes previous flex-searches and allows for simulation of both optimized and mapped electrodes.
- system monitor -> added a GUI tab that allows users monitor the activity of processes hapenning within the toolbox

#### Fixes
- pre-process -> added missing shell for recon-all step
- pre-process -> fixed parallalization problem
- ex-search redesign -> now is not dependent on MATLAB Runtime, but is fully Python implemented
- ex-search -> users can now creat multiple leadfields for the same subject
- flex-search -> post processing method for TI envelope direction is implemented

### v2.0.3

**Release Date**: June 20, 2025

#### Additions
- Modified tes_flex_optimization.py to include eeg_net field in the .json
- toggle between "Montage Simulation" (traditional) and "Flex-Search Simulation" with automatic discovery of optimization results and electrode type selection (mapped/optimized/both)
- Modified TI.py and pipeline scripts to handle direct XYZ electrode coordinates instead of just electrode names, enabling optimized electrode positioning from flex-search results

#### Fixes
- N/A

### v2.0.2

**Release Date**: June 19, 2025

#### Additions
- Enhanced X11 support for Windows with automatic host IP detection and VcXsrv/Xming configuration guidance
- Created `windows_x11_setup.sh` helper script for simplified Windows X server setup
- Added comprehensive Windows BIDS path guide (`WINDOWS_BIDS_PATH_GUIDE.md`) with troubleshooting tips
- Improved cross-platform X11 configuration with better error handling and user guidance
- Added OpenGL software rendering flags for better GUI compatibility across all platforms

#### Fixes
- Fixed volume mounting in docker-compose.yml - all required volumes now properly mounted to simnibs container
- Fixed Windows path handling - automatic conversion of backslashes to forward slashes for Docker compatibility
- Fixed paths with spaces on Windows - automatic quoting of paths containing spaces
- Fixed X11 socket mounting for macOS XQuartz and Linux compatibility
- Fixed DISPLAY environment variable configuration for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Fixed MATLAB Runtime library paths in container environment
- Updated XQuartz version warning to reference memory about v2.7.7 compatibility requirement
