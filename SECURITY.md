## Reporting a Vulnerability

TI-Toolbox is software for temporal interference research. It is not expected that using TI-Toolbox will lead to security vulnerabilities under normal use cases. However, if you think you have found a security vulnerability in TI-Toolbox, please do not report it as a GitHub issue, in order to keep the vulnerability confidential. Instead, please report it to ihaber@wisc.edu and include a description and proof-of-concept that is short and self-contained.

Generally you will receive a response within one week. TI-Toolbox does not award bounties for security vulnerabilities.
