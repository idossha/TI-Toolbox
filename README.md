# TI-CSC Toolbox

## Overview

The **TI-CSC Toolbox** designed for advanced simulations and analyses related to Temporal Interference (TI). It integrates several open-source applications along with custom in-house scripts, providing a robust platform for academic research. The toolbox is intended strictly for academic, non-profit use.

## Features

- **SimNIBS**: A simulation environment for transcranial brain stimulation, enabling electric field modeling.
- **FSL**: A comprehensive library of tools for analysis of functional and structural brain imaging data.
- **FreeSurfer**: A software suite for the analysis and visualization of structural and functional neuroimaging data.
- **Gmsh**: A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with a built-in CAD engine and post-processor.
- **Custom Scripts**: In-house developed scripts optimized for specific tasks within the TI-CSC pipeline, including mesh processing, NIfTI conversion, and ROI management.

## Usage

The TI-CSC Toolbox is designed for researchers conducting studies in neurostimulation and related fields. To ensure reproducibility and proper citation of the tools used, users are required to:

1. **Acknowledge** the use of the TI-CSC Toolbox in any publications or presentations derived from its use.
2. **Cite** the original developers of the integrated open-source applications according to their respective citation guidelines (see below).
3. **Limit usage** to academic, non-profit purposes only. Commercial use is strictly prohibited without explicit permission.
